					<h2>Sustainability</h2>
					<p>Faber-Castell has always had a constant focus on sustainability. Here are some fun sustainable facts about their company!
						<ul>
							<li>Faber-Castell’s own forests in Prata, south-east Brazil, capture 900,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). This was confirmed 
								by TÜV Rheinland® in 2012. The 10,000 hectares of forests therefore not only secure our sustainable wood needs, but also
								help decrease the burden on the atmosphere through photosynthesis, in which CO2 is converted into biomass.</li> 
							<li>One third of the company's own forests remain untouched and provide habitats for around 660 indigenous animal and plant species</li>
							<li>They sustainably manage 10,000 hectares of its own pine forests. These provide the raw material for our pencils and cover 86 percent
								of our worldwide wood demand.</li>
							<li>Every year, around 300,000 seedlings are planted in the company's own forests. We are growing one truckload of wood per hour.</li>
							<li>Faber-Castell covers 82 percent of the global energy demand from renewable sources.</li>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>The same previous concepts and points aimed at businesses and the economy can be applied to politics. Argueable the governement has just as much if not more control
					over the economic environment and the enconomy as a whole. It is a lot of times up to the public to support polticians and officals that prioritize sustainability on a large scale.
					In order for long term change to occur its important now more than ever for society to attempt to come to a agreement on sustainabiilty and the importance of it. The future of our
					planets and the resources on it depends on our ability to come togather for large-scale, long-term change.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Sustainability is currently and will remain to be one of the most important topics of our generation. Society is slowly but surely
					waking up to the reality that is the lack of sustainable living and practice across the board. In order to safeguard the future of not only our
					generation but generations to come we need to make strucutural changes to our living as soon as possible. Educating ourselves and the people around us
					is one of the first and most important steps in this process. By starting this journey on an indidivudal scale hopefully the work of many can contibute 
					to the eventual whole.</p>
