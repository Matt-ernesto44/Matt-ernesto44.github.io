					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>From a business perspective, social sustainability is about understanding the impacts of corporations on people and society. In corporations, social sustainability performance issues include human rights, fair labor practices, 
						living conditions, health, safety, wellness, diversity, equity, work-life balance, empowerment, community engagement, philanthropy, volunteerism, 
						and more. Though social impact, or social sustainability, issues are not easily quantifiable or measurable, they are easier to identify. According 
						to the UN Global Compact, social sustainability should be a critical part of any business because it affects the quality of a business’ relationships 
						with stakeholders. Social sustainability is a proactive way of managing and identifying business impacts on employees, workers in the value chain, customers, 
						and local communities. Companies that raise the importance of social sustainability recognize the significance of their relationships with people, communities 
						and society. Social responsibility becomes part of their core business strategy and they consider how their activities affect people. There is a human cost to 
						doing business. A socially sustainable business will consider the safety of its workers in a particular location. It will not allow its workers’ safety to be 
						compromised by forcing them to work in a building that has been deemed unsafe.</p>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>The same previous concepts and points aimed at businesses and the economy can be applied to politics. Argueable the governement has just as much if not more control
					over the economic environment and the enconomy as a whole. It is a lot of times up to the public to support polticians and officals that prioritize sustainability on a large scale.
					In order for long term change to occur its important now more than ever for society to attempt to come to a agreement on sustainabiilty and the importance of it. The future of our
					planets and the resources on it depends on our ability to come togather for large-scale, long-term change.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Sustainability is currently and will remain to be one of the most important topics of our generation. Society is slowly but surely
					waking up to the reality that is the lack of sustainable living and practice across the board. In order to safeguard the future of not only our
					generation but generations to come we need to make strucutural changes to our living as soon as possible. Educating ourselves and the people around us
					is one of the first and most important steps in this process. By starting this journey on an indidivudal scale hopefully the work of many can contibute 
					to the eventual whole.</p>
