					<h2>Sustainability</h2>
					<p class="aligncenter"><strong>Faber-Castell has always had a constant focus on sustainability. Here are some fun sustainable facts about their company!</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Faber-Castell’s own forests in Prata, south-east Brazil, capture 900,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2). This was confirmed 
								by TÜV Rheinland® in 2012. The 10,000 hectares of forests therefore not only secure our sustainable wood needs, but also
								help decrease the burden on the atmosphere through photosynthesis, in which CO2 is converted into biomass.</li> 
							<li>One third of the company's own forests remain untouched and provide habitats for around 660 indigenous animal and plant species</li>
							<li>They sustainably manage 10,000 hectares of its own pine forests. These provide the raw material for our pencils and cover 86 percent
								of our worldwide wood demand.</li>
							<li>Every year, around 300,000 seedlings are planted in the company's own forests. We are growing one truckload of wood per hour.</li>
							<li>Faber-Castell covers 82 percent of the global energy demand from renewable sources.</li>

					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>A pioneering brand, and one of the oldest industrial companies in the world, A. W. Castell, as it was then known, was founded in 1761 in Stein,
						near Nuremberg in Germany. Cabinet maker Kaspar Faber set up the company, and it has been a true family passion ever since, continued from 
						generation to generation. The company’s first ever product was the (then revolutionary) graphite pencil, released onto the market in 1761.
						Faber-Castell is in fact the world’s oldest pencil manufacturer. This product has been in constant production ever since, and is still a popular
						product now.Kaspar Faber’s ambitious great-grandson, Baron Lothar, took over from him at a later date. When Lothar’s granddaughter married a cadet
						of the Counts of Castell, the new name of Faber-Castell was born.Faber-Castell continues to produce innovative designs which are not only striking to look at,
						but which are also enjoyable to use and reliable in their operation. The company has built up an extensive
						collection of retail products including wood-cased pencils, coloured pencils, mechanical pencils, fountain pens, ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, and erasers.
						Faber-Castell products are popular in the home, office and school, and with artists, writers, adults, children… pretty much anyone who has ever used one of the products.</p>
