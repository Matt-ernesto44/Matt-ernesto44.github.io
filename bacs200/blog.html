					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>Social sustainability occurs when the formal and informal processes; systems; structures; and relationships actively support 
						the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and livable communities.
						Socially sustainable communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life. 
						Social sustainability is a process for creating sustainable successful places that promote wellbeing, by understanding 
						what people need from the places they live and work. Social sustainability combines design of the physical realm with design 
						of the social world – infrastructure to support social and cultural life, social amenities, systems for citizen engagement, 
						and space for people and places to evolve. Its very important to know that in order to successfully practice social sustainability
					people must work individually to practice sustainability in their own lives to contribute the whole. This means being concious of your use of 
					non-renuable materials such as plastic, and just generally keeping yourself educated on how you can adapt your lifestyle to be more sustainable.</p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>From a business perspective, social sustainability is about understanding the impacts of corporations on people and society. In the triple bottom 
						line (TBL) model, social sustainability is the least quantifiable part of sustainability. The TBL is an accounting framework of three parts: 
						social, environmental and financial. The TBL framework has been adopted by organizations to evaluate performance. The three aspects interrelate 
						to determine a corporation’s performance. In corporations, social sustainability performance issues include human rights, fair labor practices, 
						living conditions, health, safety, wellness, diversity, equity, work-life balance, empowerment, community engagement, philanthropy, volunteerism, 
						and more. Though social impact, or social sustainability, issues are not easily quantifiable or measurable, they are easier to identify. According 
						to the UN Global Compact, social sustainability should be a critical part of any business because it affects the quality of a business’ relationships 
						with stakeholders. Social sustainability is a proactive way of managing and identifying business impacts on employees, workers in the value chain, customers, 
						and local communities. Companies that raise the importance of social sustainability recognize the significance of their relationships with people, communities 
						and society. Social responsibility becomes part of their core business strategy and they consider how their activities affect people. There is a human cost to 
						doing business. A socially sustainable business will consider the safety of its workers in a particular location. It will not allow its workers’ safety to be 
						compromised by forcing them to work in a building that has been deemed unsafe.</p>
