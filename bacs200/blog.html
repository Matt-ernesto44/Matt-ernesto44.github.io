					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>Social sustainability occurs when the formal and informal processes; systems; structures; and relationships actively support 
						the capacity of current and future generations to create healthy and livable communities.
						Socially sustainable communities are equitable, diverse, connected and democratic and provide a good quality of life. 
						Social sustainability is a process for creating sustainable successful places that promote wellbeing, by understanding 
						what people need from the places they live and work. Social sustainability combines design of the physical realm with design 
						of the social world – infrastructure to support social and cultural life, social amenities, systems for citizen engagement, 
						and space for people and places to evolve. Its very important to know that in order to successfully practice social sustainability
					people must work individually to practice sustainability in their own lives to contribute the whole. This means being concious of your use of 
					non-renuable materials such as plastic, and just generally keeping yourself educated on how you can adapt your lifestyle to be more sustainable.</p>
