  <h1>I'd Like to Think My Sense of Humor is Still Intact <strong>LMAO</strong></h1>
    <p>by Matt Moreno</p>

    <p>The internet has always been an escape for me and a lot of times, in my opinion, a platform that lets the world laugh at itself.</p>

    <h2>One of My Favorite Videos</h2>
    <p>One of the most epic arguments in our american history.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uznUlgpKBzE">The Wicked Witch of the East Bro!</a>

    <h2>I Am Convinced This is the Funniest Woman on the Internet</h2>
    <p>Brittany Broski makes some of the funniest content I have ever seen and her videos never fail to get me to roll on the floor laughing.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrCa_6ov1F8&t=310s">I have never in my life been more inspired to make some green bean casserole</a>

    <h2>Classic and Yet Still Hilarious</h2>
    <p>Vine will forever be one of the most creative and most laugh inducing platforms to ever exist on the internet. There are countless vines that I still laugh at to this day but this is one of my favorites.</p>
