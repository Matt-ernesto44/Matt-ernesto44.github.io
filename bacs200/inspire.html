        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Creativity</strong> - They look at the world in ways that an ordinary person wouldn't</li>
        <li><strong>Motivate others</strong> - people follow a great leader and teacher</li>
        <li><strong>Big footprint</strong> - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        <li><strong>genuine</strong> - they wear their hearts upon their chests and embrace their passions</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity</strong> - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Over my lifetime no person exemplifies these values for me more than
        Bob Ross. I have always remembered having a deep passion and love for art. It can
        so easy to forget why you are creating in the first place. Watching Bob Ross,
        he taught me to embrace myself as an artist and not hold back from using my
        art as an outlet for my emotions. He taught me how to let go. Throughout his  
        years as artist he gave that gift to thousands of people across the globe.
